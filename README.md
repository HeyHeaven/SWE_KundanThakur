Satellite Data Pipeline for Space Agencies
What is it?


A large-scale data pipeline designed to process, store, and deliver satellite data ranging from terabytes to petabytes. It ensures scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance for mission-critical space applications.

How does it work?


Thought Process:

"Terabytes to petabytes," "real-time," "scalability," "high availability," and "fault tolerance" immediately scream distributed systems and big data architecture. I'll need a layered approach: ingestion, raw storage, processing, processed storage, and finally access. Message queues, distributed file systems, and computation frameworks will be central.

Explanation of Components:


1. Satellite Ground Stations: The source of raw telemetry, imagery, and other sensor data.

2. Data Ingestion Layer:
	- Load Balancer: Distributes incoming data streams across multiple ingestion nodes.

	- Ingestion API/Collectors: Highly scalable, custom applications or commercial tools designed to receive data, perform basic validation, and push it to a message queue.

	- Message Queue (e.g., Kafka, AWS SQS/Kinesis): A high-throughput, fault-tolerant buffer that decouples the ingestion from processing. Essential for real-time streams and handling backpressure.


3. Scalable Raw Storage Layer (e.g., HDFS, AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage):
	- Stores all incoming raw satellite data exactly as received. This is typically immutable, cost-effective object storage, serving as the "source of truth" and enabling historical reprocessing.

	- Fault Tolerance: Achieved through data replication (e.g., S3's durability, HDFS replication factor).


4. Processing & Analytics Layer:
	- Stream Processing (e.g., Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink): Processes data from the message queue in near real-time (e.g., filtering, real-time alerts, quick look products).

	- Batch Processing (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop MapReduce): Runs complex, long-running analyses on vast amounts of raw data in the distributed storage (e.g., generating long-term climate models, large-scale image analysis).

	- Machine Learning Frameworks: For advanced analytics, pattern recognition, anomaly detection (e.g., identifying cloud cover, land changes).

	- Data Catalog: Manages metadata about all datasets (raw and processed), ensuring discoverability and understanding.

	- Fault Tolerance & HA: Achieved through the inherent fault-tolerance of Spark/Flink (checkpointing, distributed execution), resource managers (YARN, Kubernetes), and redundant worker nodes.


5. Scalable Processed Storage Layer (e.g., Data Lakes (e.g., Delta Lake on S3), NoSQL databases like Cassandra/HBase, Columnar DBs like Vertica/Snowflake):
	- Stores derived datasets, aggregated results, and mission-specific products. Optimized for fast retrieval and analytical queries.


6. Access & Retrieval Layer:
	- RESTful APIs (e.g., GraphQL, custom REST): Provides structured access to processed data for scientists and applications.

	- Data Lake Query Engines (e.g., Presto, Athena): Allows direct, interactive querying of data in the processed storage.

	- Visualization Dashboards: Tools for end-users to explore and visualize data (e.g., Grafana, Tableau).

	- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures only authorized users/agencies can access specific datasets, often integrated with an Identity Management system.
