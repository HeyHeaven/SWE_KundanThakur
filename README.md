Satellite Data Pipeline for Space Agencies
What is it?


A large-scale data pipeline designed to process, store, and deliver satellite data ranging from terabytes to petabytes. It ensures scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance for mission-critical space applications.

How does it work?


Thought Process:

"Terabytes to petabytes," "real-time," "scalability," "high availability," and "fault tolerance" immediately scream distributed systems and big data architecture. I'll need a layered approach: ingestion, raw storage, processing, processed storage, and finally access. Message queues, distributed file systems, and computation frameworks will be central.
